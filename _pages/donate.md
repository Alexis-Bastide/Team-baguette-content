You can also donate by check to:
<h5>Mission for the Homeless

&nbsp;

Whichever way you prefer, we'll send you a tax-deductible donation receipt for your records.
(EIN/Tax ID number: 46-0674496)
One hundred percent of your donation goes to help the homeless as we are a small group of volunteers with no salaries, overhead, or administrative costs.

We do, however, need help in defraying operating costs like nightly purchases of thrift store blankets, bottled water, and gas to reach Oakland's homeless each night.

</div>
If you prefer to donate goods rather than money,we are always in need of:
<ul>
 	<li>blankets</li>
 	<li>sleeping bags</li>
 	<li>tents</li>
 	<li>bottled water/soft drinks</li>
 	<li>clothing (warm coats, beanies/hats, gloves, etc.)</li>
 	<li>shoes and socks</li>
</ul>
We greatly appreciate your help!
