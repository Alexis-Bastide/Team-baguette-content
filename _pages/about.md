<h3 class="widget-title">Areas of Oakland That We Serve</h3>
<p>Volunteer work at Alameda County Medical Center (Highland Campus) by one or our members led to the expansion of our services (initially in West Oakland). We began reaching the homeless located in the Fruitvale District not far from Highland Hospital, which stretches from the 880 Freeway near International Blvd. to the hills below Montclair. One of the local bakeries there started providing us with bread and pastries on a daily basis. A local church group donated blankets. A local market occasionally donated packaged snacks, like potato chips, as well as canned, boxed and frozen food. Since the fall of 2011 we’ve expanded to the downtown and Chinatown areas of Oakland.</p>
<h3 class="widget-title">Division of Tasks</h3>
<p>The founder of Mission for the Homeless is the main person who does the person to person outreach on a nightly basis. One volunteer purchases the food prepared for the evening meals. Another purchases blankets, pays for food, and provides the station wagon for the nightly rounds.</p>

It is easy to become impatient when dealing with the homeless and that can be a problem.&nbsp; Some homeless people sense that impatience and refuse help.
