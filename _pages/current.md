<h3 class="widget-title">Intervening to help people in danger on the streets</h3>
We help people find emergency care, and have benefited over the years by a continuing relationship with the professionals who staff Alameda County’s medical and social services: doctors, nurses and social workers at Highland Hospital, for instance. The team operating the city’s <a href="http://mhaac.org/need-help-now.html">Mobile Crises Unit for Mental Health</a> has also been invaluable in assessing and transporting the homeless in a crisis. <a href="http://www.stmaryscenter.org/">St. Mary’s Center</a> in West Oakland helps place the homeless in housing and provides a <a href="http://stmaryscenter.org/emergency-winter-shelter/">winter shelter</a> of their own. We often rely on the Oakland Police Department itself in an emergency situation. Other important resources include the <a href="http://www.thecil.org/">Center for Independent Living</a> a services and advocacy organization run by and for people with disabilities with offices in Oakland and Berkeley; and <a href="http://operationdignity.org/">Operation Dignity, Inc.</a> support services for veteran families, offering transitional and permanent housing as well as a mobile outreach team that is instrumental in helping the homeless vet in a crisis situation.

Care continues for those struggling with mental and physical distress by assisting them into shelters and medical facilities like Highland Hospital and <a href="http://www.acmedctr.org/johngeorge.cfm">John George Psychiatric Pavilion</a>, a psychiatric emergency services department both for voluntary and involuntary  "5150" admissions with inpatient units for longer term psychiatric holds. Substance abuse programs like <a href="http://horizonservices.org/cherry-hill-detoxification-program-services/">Cherry Hill Sobering &amp; Detox Center</a> in nearby San Leandro are also helpful.
