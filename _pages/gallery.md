Recently he wasn't able to stand when he woke in the morning. He finally agreed to go to Summit Hospital where the doctors diagnosed severe arthritis aggravated by the cold nights outdoors. They transferred him to the Fruitvale Healthcare Center where we hope he will stay to have his health problems dealt with. Update: Paul likes the Fruitvale Center and is happy there." width="275" height="300" /><img class="attachment-medium size-medium" title="" src="http://missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/group-300x200.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/group.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i2.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/group.jpg?w=760 760w" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><img class="attachment-medium size-medium" title="" src="http://missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lady-main-300x200.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lady-main.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i1.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lady-main.jpg?w=586 586w" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><img class="attachment-medium size-medium" title="" src="http://missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/youngboy-300x200.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/youngboy.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, https://i1.wp.com/missionforthehomeless.josephpazhman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/youngboy.jpg?w=720 720w" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
