<h3 class="widget-title">Plight of the Homeless</h3>
<p>The plight of the homeless in Oakland is becoming more evident as the economy has made it more difficult for those “fallen through the cracks”. Often stereotyped as annoying, categorized as worthless, the homeless easily become objects of neglect and abuse. If family, society and church remain uninterested and unconvinced as to the inherent dignity of these people, we continue to recognize them without judgment or condemnation. &nbsp;The question that remains is how to address these issues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We visit homeless people on the street on a one to one basis. We know of no other shelter or homeless service in Oakland that attempts this type of outreach. The focus has always been providing basic necessities like food, blankets and warm clothing. One of our inspirations was a local organization called <a href="http://ebfnb.org/">Food Not Bombs</a> which provides a hearty hot meal, like lentils, served daily in People’s Park area of Berkeley.
